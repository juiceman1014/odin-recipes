    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banh Baos are a steamed Vietnamese bun filled 
        with a pork mixture, quail egg, and chinese sausage.
        This is another childhood favorite of mine and the recipe

            (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 water chestnuts (finely chopped)</li>

        <li>quail eggs (sold fresh or in cans in Asian supermarkets)</li>
        <li>1 red shallot (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp spring onion (finely chopped)</li>

        <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 tsp fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps for the Bao</h3>    
<ol>
    <li>Combine the flour, yeast and sugar in a bowl 
        then pour in the water and milk. 
        Mix it in until incorporated then 
        let it rest for 3 hours so the yeast has time to 
        activate.</li>
    <li>Pour the remaining flour, self-raising flour, 
        sugar, lemon juice, egg white and oil into the 
        activated mixtue and knead it until a smooth dough 
        forms.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest in a bowl for 30 minutes with a 
        cloth or glad wrap over the top.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps for the Filling</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine the pork mince and pork paste 
        along with the pepper, chicken bouillon powder, 
        salt, sugar, oyster sayce and fish sauce.</li>
    <li>Mix in the wood ear mushroom, water chestnuts, 
        shallots, fried onions and spring onions.</li>
    <li>Roll about 1/4 US cup of the pork mixture into a ball, 
        flatten it in your palm and place a 
        quail egg in the center.</li>
    <li>Wrap the mixture around the quail egg and roll 
        it to form a sphere then push a sliced Chinese 
        sausage on the surface.</li>
    <li>Leave it to sit on a plate as you roll the rest of the 
        mince. Depending on each ball size, you'll get 
        roughly 6 balls.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Steps for Wrapping the Baos</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut 15 cm x 15 cm (6″ x 6″) squares out of baking paper.</li>
    <li>Divide the Banh Bao dough into equal segments and roll them into balls. Cover using a cloth as you work on each to avoid drying.</li>
    <li>Flatten each ball into a circle approximately 20 cm (8″) wide using a rolling pin or a smooth cup.</li>
    <li>Place a meatball in the center of the flattened dough.</li>
    <li>Bring the top and bottom parts of the Banh Bao dough in and pinch to stick together over the meatball.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same steps with the left and right sides of the rolled dough.</li>
    <li>Where the openings are for each corner, push the tips in to form a heart shape. You'll end up with four hearts.</li>
    <li>Pinch each heart's tips to close the openings.</li>
    <li>Hold one pinched tip and pull it to the center, pinching it with the dough in the middle to allow it to stick. Repeat with all pinched tips.</li>
    <li>Give the center one final pinch to seal all the dough.</li>
    <li>Place the wrapped bun on a baking square.</li>
    <li>Set up your steamer to a boil and steam the baos for 30 minutes or until the meatball is cooked.</li>
    <li>Serve fresh as is or with a drizzle of Sirarcha!</li>
</ol>
